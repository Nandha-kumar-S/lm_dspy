        "question": "consider a rocket in free space having two engines with identical isp, connected to a single propellant system. recall that the relationship between specific impulse and exhaust velocity is  vexhaust  = go * isp.\nif one engine fails, what is the impact on the total  \u03b4v  that can be obtained from the system?",
        "choices": "['\u03b4v will double', '\u03b4v will be cut in half', '\u03b4v will stay the same']",
        "reasoning": "The total delta-v that can be obtained from the system is directly proportional to the total mass of propellant burned. Since the propellant system is shared between the two engines, the total mass of propellant burned is the same regardless of which engine fails. The only difference is that the remaining engine will burn the propellant alone, whereas it would have burned half of the propellant with the other engine. \nIn terms of specific impulse, the relationship between specific impulse and exhaust velocity is vexhaust  = go * isp. Therefore, if one engine fails, the total delta-v obtained from the system will remain the same.",

        "reasoning": "The primary driver to choose between a closed-loop or an open-loop ECLSS (Environmental Control and Life Support System) is the mission duration. A closed-loop ECLSS is typically used for longer-duration missions, where the system can recycle and reuse resources, such as air, water, and waste. An open-loop ECLSS, on the other hand, is used for shorter-duration missions, where the system relies on resupply from Earth or other sources.",
