## Running the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct Model

To serve the any model using VLLM, you can use the following command. This command specifies the model to be served, sets the data type to `float16` or `float32`, and includes your API key for authentication.

```bash
vllm serve model_name --dtype float16 --api-key any_key
```

Once you run the above command, you are good to go with using your dataset and utilizing the code in this repository.
